With the development of artificial intelligence, it becomes possible to use it to classify medical images. Large data streams obtained as a result of patient examinations can be analyzed with greater speed and sufficient accuracy. This article presents the results of the analysis of MRI images of the brain for the presence of tumors by using convolutional neural networks.
